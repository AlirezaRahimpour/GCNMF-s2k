## HVAC_ORNL_UTK dataset ##
![LD](/LD.png)

This repository includes our collected dataset for HVAC component energy disaggregation as well as 
source code and demo for our paper:[Non-Intrusive Energy Disaggregation Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization with Sum-to-k Constraint.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7835299/)
To the best of our knowledge this is the first collected dataset for studying NILM for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. 

Energy disaggregation or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) addresses
the issue of extracting device-level energy consumption information by monitoring
the aggregated signal at one single measurement point without installing meters on each
individual device. Energy disaggregation can be formulated as a source separation problem where
the aggregated signal is expressed as linear combination of basis vectors in a matrix factorization
framework. In this work we use machine learning in order to predict the pattern of energy consumption
of each device during a day. This project is one part of our collaboration with [DOE](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1265590-non-intrusive-load-monitoring-hvac-components-using-signal-unmixing).



###prerequisite:###
MATLAB R2015a

###Datasets###
We design two different experiments for
evaluating our proposed algorithm. The first experiment is
disaggregation of the whole home energy to the energy consumption
of all the appliances at a residential home. 
For this part we use the [AMPds](http://ampds.org/): A Public Dataset for
Load Disaggregation and Eco-Feedback Research for
the first experiment. This dataset has most required features
for performing an accurate disaggregation task.

The second experiment is based on designing a hierarchical scheme for
disaggregating the whole building energy signal to the HVAC
components signals (i.e., two compressors, two condenser fan and one indoor
blower) in an industrial building.

##HVAC_ORNL_UTK dataset for NILM

For this experiment, we collected the data at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Flexible Research
Platform (FRP1). FRP1 was constructed to enable
research into building envelope materials, construction methods,
building equipment, and building instrumentation, control,
and fault detection.

Our experiment in this part consists of two major steps: 

1-Disaggregation of the power signal of whole building to power
signals of all the circuits and devices existing in the building.

There are 16 different devices, circuits and plugs in the building:
HVAC unit, 480/208 Transformer, lighting circuits: 1, 3, 5, 7,
Plug circuits: 1, 3, 5, 7, cord reel circuit, lighting control box,
exhaust fan, piping heat trace, exterior lighting (lighting and
emergency) and building control circuit. 

2-Decomposition of the obtained HVAC power signal from the previous step and
estimating the power consumption profile of its components
including: two compressors, two condenser fan and one indoor
blower. The above Figure illustrates this hierarchical architecture.

Please see the [data folder](/data/?at=master) and ([The ORNL dataset details.](/data/ORNL_data_info.zip)) for details of all the 
collected data in different time spans during the year in FRP1 and FRP2. 
* For getting the whole ORNL data please contact [Alireza Rahimpour](mailto:arahimpo@utk.edu). 
Please kindly cite our [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7835299/) if you find this paper and dataset useful. 

###Demo###
Run the [`Demo.m`](/Demo.m) to see the result of disaggregation algorithm on the AMPds dataset. 
Please put the [`AMP_DATA.mat`](/AMP_DATA.mat) in the same folder when running the [`Demo.m`](/Demo.m).


* If parameter `training=1`, code performs the signal decomposition only without prediction. 

* For prediction: `training=0`.

* Please see the guide in the beginning of the demo code to see how you can apply different methods such as Non-negative Sparse coding and Elastic Net. 



###Results###
You should see the following results (and a lot more!) after running the demo. 

* Ground truth and estimated appliancesï¿½ signals using the S2K-NMF method for one random testing day (1440 minutes).
