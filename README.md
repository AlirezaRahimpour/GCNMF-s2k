# Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring #
![LD](/LD.png)
Energy disaggregation or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) addresses the issue of extracting device-level energy consumption information by monitoring the aggregated signal at one single measurement point without installing meters on each individual device. Energy disaggregation can be formulated as a source separation problem where the aggregated signal is expressed as linear combination of basis vectors in a matrix factorization framework.
